# Thinkful Tube a11y refactor

As a sighted keyboard user:
- [x] I should be able to use the keyboard alone to access core information in the app.
  - [x] I should be able to use and submit the form with the keyboard.
  - [x] Tab should take me through links to each YouTube video and I should be able to activate the links with the keyboard.
- [x] I should be given textual feedback when results appear, including the number of results.

As a screen reader user, I should be able to accomplish the above and:
- [ ] I should be aurally notified when results appear on the page
- [ ] I should be able to understand the purpose of each focusable element
- [ ] I should know which video each link will open.
- [ ] I should also know if an action will open or close a lightbox.
